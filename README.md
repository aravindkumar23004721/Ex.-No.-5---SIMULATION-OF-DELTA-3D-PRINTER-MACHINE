## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Delta 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Delta 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Delta 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
### 1.	Move the z1-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z1-axis assembly.
### 2.	Move the z2-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z2-axis assembly.
### 3.	Move the z3-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z3-axis assembly.
